This directory contains all code used within the project.

Primary code file for consolidating and displaying simulation results is 
'TREATNOW_Simulations_Upstrap_MethodComparisonResults'

Three subfolders are included for simplicity:
'Test Code' - code that is tangentially related and does not directly lead
to actionable analysis

'Manuscript Figure Generation Code' - includes all code used to specifically
create amnuscript versions of all submitted figures

'ShinyApp' - all code related to development and maintenance of the R Shiny 
application
