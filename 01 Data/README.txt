This directory contains a separate folder with each iteration 
of the simulated data results (including both raw and 
processed results.

The 'Upstrap 10-3-2022 Results' folder contains the final 
dataset used for all manuscript analysis, the other two 
folders contain results from previous iterations that are 
kept for sake of completeness and reproducibility but are 
unlikely to be referenced again.

Within the folders all datasets are distinctly labeled.  
For detains on data generation and processing see the R 
scripts/comments.
